
So if you reed this is firstly want to say thank you for your interest in my Profile ;)
So basic function:
You just need a change Profile button that sends you to S1, thats the first keypad layer.
On S1 every key just sends you to the "Falscheingabe (wrong input in german lol)" profile, except of the digit 1, as it is the right number. It sends you to S2 where its the same thing.
That means you can use custom Passwords that can basically be infinitely long, just copy S2, and make sure every wrong press sends you to the profile "Falscheingabe (wrong input in german lol)" and the right digit sends you to the next layer.
The last right press just sends you to the profile "Shutdown",where you then confirm your shutdown, and the press shuts your PC down automatically (Using win+D , then alt+f4 and lastly Enter.)
Hope you enjoy it,
Nico.
